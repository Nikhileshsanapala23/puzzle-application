DESCRIPTION
This web application is designed as a puzzle game to assess the soft skills of users. The game is based on the concept of a treasure hunt, where users follow a trail of clues to uncover the hidden treasures. The puzzle incorporates various challenges and tasks that test the users' soft skills such as attention to detail, perseverance, critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, communication, time management, adaptability, teamwork, and resilience.

The web application consists of two main pages - index.html and puzzle.html. The index.html page serves as the homepage, where users can create an account with their email address to participate in the game. Once logged in, users can start the puzzle game by clicking on the "Start" button. The puzzle.html page is the main puzzle page, where users will find the clues and solve the challenges to progress through the game.

The puzzle game includes a minimum of 5 clues, 2 dead-ends, and 1 solution. The clues can be in the form of text, images, videos, links, or other interactive elements that users need to find and decipher to uncover the next clue. The game progress and user data, such as time taken for each step and solution accuracy, are stored in the backend database for tracking and analysis.

The web application also includes an admin dashboard that allows the admin to monitor the progress of all users, view user analytics, and track the leaderboard. The admin dashboard provides insights into user performance, solution accuracy, and other relevant metrics through graphs and tables for data analysis.
